# AI Agentic Engineering Course Setup - Build Summary

## Overview
Successfully built and configured the complete environment for Edward Donner's "Master AI Agentic Engineering" course, which teaches how to build autonomous AI Agents using various frameworks.

## What Was Built

### 1. **Repository Cloned**
- Cloned the course repository from: https://github.com/ed-donner/agents.git
- Location: `/workspace/agents`

### 2. **Package Manager Installed**
- Installed `uv` - a fast, modern Python package manager
- Version: 0.8.0
- Installation method: Standalone installer

### 3. **Python Environment Created**
- Python version: 3.12.11
- Virtual environment location: `/workspace/agents/.venv`
- All course dependencies installed successfully

### 4. **Dependencies Installed**
Total of 214 packages installed, including:
- **AI/ML Frameworks**: OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, LangGraph, AutoGen
- **Agent Frameworks**: CrewAI (v0.148.0), OpenAI Agents, Semantic Kernel
- **Supporting Libraries**: Gradio, Playwright, BeautifulSoup, and many more

### 5. **CrewAI Tool Installed**
- Installed as a standalone tool using `uv tool install crewai`
- Ready for Week 3 of the course

### 6. **Configuration Files Created**
- Created `.env` file with placeholder API keys for:
  - OpenAI
  - Google/Gemini
  - Anthropic
  - DeepSeek

## Course Structure

The course is organized into 6 weeks:
1. **Week 1 - Foundations** (`1_foundations/`)
2. **Week 2 - OpenAI** (`2_openai/`)
3. **Week 3 - CrewAI** (`3_crew/`)
4. **Week 4 - LangGraph** (`4_langgraph/`)
5. **Week 5 - AutoGen** (`5_autogen/`)
6. **Week 6 - MCP** (`6_mcp/`)

Additional resources:
- Setup guides for different operating systems
- Course guides and troubleshooting notebooks
- Assets and examples

## Verification Results

Ran diagnostics script which confirmed:
- ✅ Python 3.12.11 installed
- ✅ Virtual environment active
- ✅ All required packages installed
- ✅ .env file present with API key placeholders
- ✅ Git repository properly configured
- ✅ Network connectivity working
- ⚠️ Speedtest failed (non-critical)

## Next Steps

To start the course:
1. Replace the placeholder API keys in `.env` with actual keys
2. Open the first lab: `1_foundations/1_lab1.ipynb`
3. Select the Python kernel from `.venv`
4. Begin learning!

## Notes

- The setup supports multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek)
- Can use free alternatives like Ollama if preferred
- Course emphasizes hands-on building of autonomous AI agents
